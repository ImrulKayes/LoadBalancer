# LoadBalancer
C and CSIM based simulation models for four load balancers: random, round robin, shortest queue, and shortest queue with  stale load information.

Load balancing algorithms play a critical role in systems where the workload has to be distributed across multiple resources such as cores in multiprocessor system, computers in distributed computing, network links etc. 
In this project, we study and evaluate four load balancing methods: random, round robin, shortest queue, and shortest queue with stale load information. We build a simulation model and compare mean delay of the system for the load balancing methods.
Additionally, we provide a method to improve shortest queue with stale load information load balancing method.
